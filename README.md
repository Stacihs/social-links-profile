## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In the past, I've used variable font static pages. This time is used the variable file. I learned how flexible this is and, as always, you still need to add a fallback font to account for browsers where this is not supported.

### Continued development

After I get more comfortable with the fundamentals of CSS, I plan on exploring CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap and Tailwind.
